/*
 *  Simple example of a CUnit unit test.
 *
 *  This program (crudely) demonstrates a very simple "black box"
 *  test of the standard library functions fprintf() and fread().
 *  It uses suite initialization and cleanup functions to open
 *  and close a common temporary file used by the test functions.
 *  The test functions then write to and read from the temporary
 *  file in the course of testing the library functions.
 *
 *  The 2 test functions are added to a single CUnit suite, and
 *  then run using the CUnit Basic interface.  The output of the
 *  program (on CUnit version 2.0-2) is:
 *
 *           CUnit : A Unit testing framework for C.
 *           http://cunit.sourceforge.net/
 *
 *       Suite: Suite_1
 *         Test: test of fprintf() ... passed
 *         Test: test of fread() ... passed
